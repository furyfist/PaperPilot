# Here I have stored some of my learnings while making this project :)

## Python Packages and **init**.py

- `__init__.py` files mark a folder as a Python package, allowing you to import modules from it.
- They can be empty or contain initialization code for the package.
- Organizing code into multiple files and folders (with `__init__.py`) is better for larger projects, making code easier to manage and reuse.
- Functionality can be the same as writing all code in one file, but splitting code improves readability and maintainability.
