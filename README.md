#  PaperPilot: AI Research Navigator

PaperPilot is a project designed to tackle information overload in scientific research. Instead of manually sifting through thousands of papers, this tool builds an intelligent and interactive "Idea Map" of a research field, revealing connections, key contributors, and potential areas for innovation.

This project is structured as a monorepo containing two separate applications: a **Python backend** for data processing and a **React frontend** for visualization.

## Project Architecture

  * `backend/`: A Python application responsible for fetching data from the Semantic Scholar API and processing it into a clean graph format (nodes and edges).
  * `frontend/`: A React single-page application that will read the processed data and render the interactive "Idea Map" visualization using Cytoscape.js.
  * `scripts/`: Holds standalone Python scripts used to execute the data pipeline.
  * `data_store/`: The output directory for the clean JSON data generated by the backend pipeline.

## Features

### Backend (Complete)

  * Dynamic data fetching from the Semantic Scholar API.
  * Parsing of raw academic data into a structured graph format.
  * Extraction of key entities (Papers, Authors) as nodes.
  * Extraction of key relationships (Citations, Authorship) as edges.
  * Saves the processed graph data into clean JSON files.

### Frontend (Planned)

  * Interactive graph visualization of the research network.
  * Ability to click on nodes (papers, authors) to see connections.
  * Dynamic filtering and exploration of the "Idea Map."

## Getting Started

To get the project running, you need to set up both the backend and frontend environments.

### **1. Backend Setup**

```bash
# Navigate into the backend directory
cd backend

# Create and activate a Python virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the required packages from the root directory
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```

### **2. Frontend Setup**

```bash
# Navigate into the frontend directory from the project root
cd frontend

# Install the required Node.js packages
npm install
```

-----

## Running the Project

The workflow involves two main steps: first generating the data with the backend, and then serving the visualization with the frontend.

### **Step 1: Generate the Graph Data**

From the **root directory** of the project, run the main Python script.

```bash
# Make sure your Python .venv is active
python scripts/fetch_and_save.py
```

This will create four JSON files inside the `data_store/` directory.

### **Step 2: Prepare Data for the Frontend**

The React application can only access files inside its `public` folder.

**Copy the four generated JSON files** from `data_store/` into the `frontend/public/` directory.

### **Step 3: Launch the Frontend**

Navigate into the frontend directory and start the development server.

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

This will open a new tab in your browser with the React application running. While it will be a blank template for now, it is ready for you to start building the visualization.
